It can take as much as 24 hours for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account billing data to reach Cloudability. If you still don't see billing data, then check to see whether billing files are being written to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket and that Cloudability can reach the bucket.
